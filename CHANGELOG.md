# Change Log

### v1.0.7

Removed auto-hide terminal functionality. This was very buggy during certain scenarios such as git opening neovim, and you can have the same effect by simply having a toggle terminal keybind.
Removed original auto-hide's changelog.
Removed "if switched focus with mouse" check.
Removed option to delay.
